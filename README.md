React Starter (Vite)

How to use:
1. unzip and cd into folder
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `npm run dev` to start the dev server

Notes:
- Global CSS file is src/style.css and gives a red background.
- Lottie: sample JSON included at src/assets/sample-lottie.json (placeholder). Replace with a real Lottie JSON to view animation.
